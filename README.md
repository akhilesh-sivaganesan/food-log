## Straighten Image
Photos are taken at an angle, and can be straightened to view from top.

## Classify Images
There are different categories of images like plates, boxes, or miscellaneous. 

## Potential for Time Lapse
There are a lot of possibilities here with so many photos that have been taken. If we know the edges of the plates, they can be aligned for superimposition.
